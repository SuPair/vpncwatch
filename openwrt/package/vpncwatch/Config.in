	  The vpncwatch daemon is used to keep vpnc(8) constantly
	  running.  It does two main things.  The first is to watch
	  and make sure the process is running.  If you kill vpnc,
	  vpncwatch will notice and will start it up again.  The
	  second main thing it does is test the VPN connection and
	  restarts vpnc if necessary.
