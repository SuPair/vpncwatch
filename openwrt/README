To build vpncwatch for OpenWRT, download the OpenWRT SDK and extract
it somewhere.  Copy the package/vpncwatch subdirectory here to the
package/ subdirectory in the extract SDK tree.

From the top level of the SDK, you can run:

    make clean
    make world

The built .ipk file will be in the bin/packages subdirectory.
